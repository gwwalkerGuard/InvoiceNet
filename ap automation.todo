☐ normalize the columns for total amount and invoice_date @started (3/30/2023, 11:56:43 AM)
☐ save as two different files to keep track of analytics 
☐ invoice date normalization is tricky - to be fixed later 
☐ figure out how to distribute the app and authorize new profiles 
☐ figure out where to store pdfbank
☐ put a completion key to notify when the script was ran succefully by previous users (or just give that power to the user)
☐ for some reason predict script is mixing up the name of the files (could not replicate on another day, weird)
☐ need to install requirements on main pc but data is a limiting factor
☐ remove images folder - redundant 
☐ need to set catch case for the event if current day folder is the only one in the folder 
ap personel interface: 
    (web app or local)
    ☐ notify the user 
    ☐ interface to say if the script run was success over the previous night 
    ☐ interface to correct predicted data @critical
    ☐ push corrected batch to update model @critical
    ☐ push corrected data to script
    
overnight script entails:

        ☐ add fail case for subprocess failure @low

    ☐ add skip to program if folder already sorted (maybe add a file call sorted) in func sortedFiles @high  
    ☐ parse returned data FROM AP personel
    ☐ push to payment server @critical
    ☐ add a file that is written to abpout the status of the last run


model entails:
    ☐ providing predicted data @critical 


payment server:
    ☐ needs to be set up @critical 
ETC:
    ☐ make email dynamic, allowing it to be changed for user @critical 
    ☐ make template @critical 
    ☐ give script a dev dash @high 
    ☐ clean invoicenet folder @low 
    ☐ create function to aggregate all unreadable invoices and multipages
    ☐ will need to setup email rules for new users or create an email for purely invoices 
    ☐ add a

@high can function without but best to implement
@low can function without
